# pattern-printer
A python program to create and transform character patterns without counting spaces.

## Structure
This program contains a class `Paper` to accept characters and their positions. Inside `Paper` there is a dictioary `paperdict` and a list `paperlist`. `paperdict` contains the caracters and use their position as the keys, and `paperlist` is made up of lists made up of the list of `[<position>, <character>]`. Characters can be added to `paperdict` and transformed in `paperlist` a function `sprint` will produce the strings from these characters. 

## Contributing
 I am a Python learner and a newbe to git and GitHub. I wrote this program trying to deal with some character patterns. Any advice and contribution are very welcommed. Please tell me if there is anything wrong or improper here.
